I made the .ino firmware file of the SCT013 sensor to collect the data and send the data read from the sensor through MQTT.

For the following I had to modify the my_user_config.h and the user_config_override.h file of the Tasmota library.

The data reading is done via RMS(Root Mean Square Method) As it will be inaccurate to calculating the Oscilating values of AC current.
further more callibration and tweaking of the sensor accuracy is needed. Displays data at a delay of 1 second.

Currently the Firmware only supports MQTT.
